# dublin-transit-stress
# Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for analyzing stress levels in Dublin's public transit system. The goal is to identify factors contributing to commuter stress and develop visualization and modeling tools to better understand and mitigate these stressors.
# Motivation
Understanding stress patterns among transit users can help Dublin's transportation authorities and city planners improve service quality and commuter well-being. This project aims to:

- Collect and preprocess transit usage and environmental data.

- Analyze correlations between transit conditions (e.g., delays, weather, traffic) and reported stress levels.

- Build predictive models to estimate stress based on transit events.

- Visualize stress hotspots and trend patterns across time and locations.
